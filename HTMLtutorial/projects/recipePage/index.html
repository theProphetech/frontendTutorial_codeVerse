      <li>200g spaghetti</li>
      <li>150g pancetta</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>

    <u><h2>instructions</h2></u>
    <!-- We will use OL tag because it a step by step to do. the current step rely on the previous step to wokr -->
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook
        according to the package instructions until al dente.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the spaghetti is cooking, heat a large skillet over medium heat.
        Add the diced pancetta or bacon and cook until crispy, about 5-6
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, grated Parmesan cheese,
        grated Pecorino Romano cheese, minced garlic, and a generous amount of
        freshly ground black pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the spaghetti is cooked, reserve about 1/2 cup of the pasta water,
        then drain the spaghetti and add it to the skillet with the crispy
        pancetta or bacon. Remove the skillet from heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Quickly pour the egg and cheese mixture over the hot spaghetti and
        pancetta/bacon, stirring continuously to coat the pasta evenly. The heat
        from the pasta will cook the eggs and create a creamy sauce. If the
        sauce seems too thick, gradually add some of the reserved pasta water to
        loosen it up.
      </li>
      <li>
        Taste the spaghetti carbonara and adjust the seasoning with salt and
        more black pepper if needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve the spaghetti carbonara immediately, garnished with chopped fresh
        parsley and additional grated cheese if desired.
      </li>
    </ol>
